# Realtime GPU Raytracer with Reference CPU Raytracer
This is (yet another) raytracing rendering application. It currently has CPU based and GPU based realtime (via DXR) raytracing.

The core CPU rendering code builds for Windows, Mac and Linux. The GPU realtime raytracing is currently only supported under Windows 10. 

This project initially grew from working through the great "Raytracing In One Weekend" series by Peter Shirley. This projects serves as a sample implementation of raytracing that ties the different compututation approaches of raytracing: CPU, GPU compute (CUDA) and GPU realtime (DXR). I hope this helps you in some way.

<br>

## Features
* RGB based
* CPU: multi-core, SIMD accelerated
* GPU: DXR accelerated
* Area lighting, soft shadows
* Multi-bounce GI
* Denoising (SVGF)
* Materials (lambert, metal, dielectric)
<br>

## Requirements
* Windows 10 with October 2018 Update (or later)
* DX12 Compatatible card, at least Pascal-based, Turing-based recommended
* Visual Studio 2019 (should compile in VS 2017 as well)
* Current Windows SDK 10 (10.0.18362.0 is the current latest)
<br>

## How To Build
There is a solution file,"RayTracer.sln" at the root of the project. Build "RayTracerWindows" for realtime raytracer. RayTracerConsole is a console application that runs CPU raytracing exclusively.
